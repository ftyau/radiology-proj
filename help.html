<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Login module</span></p>
<p>This module allows the user to login if they have the correct username and password combinations. 
A person may have multiple accounts, as each account has a different level of permissions, including administrator, doctor, radiologist and patient.</p>
<p>To login, the user must enter a valid username and password in the respective fields, and if there are no issues with the username and password or the database, the user will be brought to the home screen where he or she can select different modules to use.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System admin panel</span></p>
<p>ADMIN ONLY. This page can only be accesed by administrators. This page has three different modules.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insert query</span></li>

<ul>
<li>This module will allow the admin to insert new entries into the "persons", "users" and "family_doctor" tables.</li>
<li>To insert a query, the administrator must first choose the table they want to insert into. Each table will have different fields to be entered. 
The administrator has to fill out all the fields in order for the query to be properly submitted and committed to the server.</li>
</ul>

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update query</span></li>

<ul>
<li>This module will allow the admin to update existing entries into the "persons", "users" and "family_doctor" tables.</li>
<li>To update a table, the administrator must first choose the table they want to update. Each table will have different fields to be entered. 
The administrator has to fill out all the fields in order for the query to be properly submitted and committed to the server.</li>
</ul>

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Report generation</span></li>

<ul>
<li>This module will generate a list of patients with the input diagnosis and test date between two time frames.</li>
<li>The administrator will be prompt to enter a diagnosis and two dates. The query will search the database for entries with the entered diagnosis and 
between the two entered dates in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Uploading module</span></p>
<p>ADMIN AND RADIOLOGIST ONLY. In this module, the user can upload a picture from his or her own computer to a specified radiology record. These images are then stored in the database 
hosting the records, and will be available to view when searching through the radiology records.</p>
<p>To upload an image, the user must enter a valid radiology record into the text box, and choose a single existing image from their files. 
If those are all valid, then the module will return a success message and allow the user to return to the home screen.</p>
<p>The user may also choose to create a new record. From the page that creates records, the user fills in all the details for the record to be inserted.
If the input patient ID is valid, then the record will be added to the database. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search module</span></p>
<p>This module allows the user to search existing radiology records, based on keywords from the patient's name, diagnosis, description, or a 
time period for either the test date or prescribing date. If there are any results, then the user is returned with all relevant information of the matching radiology records, ordered by their level of relevance. The user can also choose to change the sorting order to sort by either the test date or prescribing date from the search results page. Depending on the user&rsquo;s permission level, only certain results will be displayed. An administrator is allowed to view all results, a doctor and radiologist are only allowed to view records that they have worked on, and a patient is only allowed to view records that they have been involved in.</p>
<p>To make a search, the user can enter keywords to search for in the corresponding text box. If multiple keywords are used, 
they should only be separated by a single space. To search between a time period, the user needs to enter the period in the format 
of "YYYY/MM/DD to YYYY/MM/DD" (with the single quotation marks). For example, a search in the time period of January 1, 2012 to March 15, 2013 
requires the user to enter "2012/01/01 to 2013/03/15".</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data analysis module</span></p>
<p>ADMIN ONLY. This module only appears on the home page if the logged in user is an administrator. Here, the user is able to create an OLAP report for data analysis 
by selecting various dimensions to search for. The returned result is a table containing all the existing combinations of the selected dimensions, 
and the total number of images associated with them.</p>
<p>To create the tables, the user can choose to show the number of images associated with the patient name, test type, or time. 
It is also possible to select a time hierarchy to search for from the dropdown menu. If none are selected, then "Weekly" will be used on default. 
When the tables are created, they may not match the existing records in the database. If this occurs, then clicking the link to refresh the tables 
will recreate the tables in the database, and allow the user to get up-to-date results by creating another OLAP report.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Installation instructions</span></p>
<p>To install the program, unzip the files and place the radiology-proj folder into the Apache Tomcat webapps folder. Next, change the details in 
the dbConnection.java in /radiology-proj/classes/Database to contain the details for your own database. Return to the /classes folder and type 'make all' in 
the terminal to execute the makefile to compile all the java files. Enter SQLPlus after that, and execute the SQL statements in sql_statements.sql 
by entering @sql_statements.sql. After all the files are set up for Tomcat, the radiology information system can be accessed by navigating 
to "localhost:8080/radiology-proj/login" or "[host]/radiology-proj/login" from your browser.</p>
<p>To make changes to the system, you can login with the default administrator account by using the username "admin" and password "111".</p>
